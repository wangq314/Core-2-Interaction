      Of course the Japanese room does have its picture alcove, and 
      in it a hanging scroll and a flower arrangement. But the scroll 
      and the flowers serve not as ornament but rather to give depth to 
      the shadows. We value a scroll above all for the way it blends with 
      the walls of the alcove, and thus we consider the mounting quite as 
      important as the calligraphy or painting. Even the greatest masterpiece
      will lose its worth as a scroll if it fails to blend with the alcove, 
      while a work of no particular distinction may blend beautifully with 
      the room and set off to unexpected advantage both itself and its 
      surroundings. Wherein lies the power of an otherwise ordinary work 
      to produce such an effect? Most often the paper, the ink, the fabric 
      of the mounting will possess a certain look of antiquity, and this 
      look of antiquity will strike just the right balance with the darkness 
      of the alcove and room.

      We have all had the experience, on a visit to one of the great temples
      of Kyoto or Nara, of being shown a scroll, one of the temple's treasures,
      hanging in a large, deeply recessed alcove. So dark are these alcoves, 
      even in bright daylight, that we can hardly discern the outlines of the 
      work; all we can do is listen to the explanation of the guide, follow 
      as best we can the all-but invisible brush strokes, and tell ourselves 
      how magnificent a painting it must be. Yet the combination of that 
      blurred old painting and the dark alcove is one of absolute harmony. 
      The lack of clarity, far from disturbing us, seems rather to suit 
      the painting perfectly.

      For the painting here is nothing more than another delicate surface 
      upon which the faint, frail light can play; it performs precisely 
      the same function as the sand-textured wall. This is why we attach 
      such importance to age and patina.

      A new painting, even one done 
      in ink monochrome or subtle pastels, can quite destroy the shadows 
      of an alcove, unless it is selected with the greatest care.
