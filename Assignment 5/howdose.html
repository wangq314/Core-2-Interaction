    <p>RISOGRAPH IS A BRAND OF DIGITAL DUPLICATORS MANUFACTURED BY THE RISO KAGAKU CORPORATION, THAT ARE DESIGNED MAINLY FOR HIGH-VOLUME PHOTOCOPYING AND PRINTING. IT WAS RELEASED IN JAPAN IN 1980. IT IS SOMETIMES CALLED A PRINTER-DUPLICATOR, AS NEWER MODELS CAN BE USED AS A NETWORK PRINTER AS WELL AS A STAND-ALONE DUPLICATOR. WHEN PRINTING OR COPYING MANY DUPLICATES (GENERALLY MORE THAN 100) OF THE SAME CONTENT, IT IS TYPICALLY FAR LESS EXPENSIVE PER PAGE THAN A CONVENTIONAL PHOTOCOPIER, LASER PRINTER, OR INKJET PRINTER.</p>
