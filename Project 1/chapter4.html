      so dilute is the light there that no matter what the season, on fair 
      days or cloudy, morning, midday, or evening, the pale, white glow 
      scarcely varies
    </div>
    <div>
      The light from the pale white paper, powerless to dispel the heavy 
      darkness of the alcove, is instead repelled by the darkness, creating 
      a world of confusion where dark and light are indistinguishable.

     Have you never felt a sort of fear in the face of the ageless, a fear 
      that in that room you might lose all consciousness of the passage of 
      time, that untold years might pass and upon emerging you should find 
      you had grown old and gray?
    </div>
    <div>
     how the gold leaf of a sliding door or screen will pick up a distant 
      glimmer from the garden, then suddenly send forth an ethereal glow, 
      a faint golden light cast into the enveloping darkness, like the glow 
      upon the horizon at sunset.
    </div>
    <div>
      Or again you may find that the gold dust of the background, which until 
      that moment had only a dull, sleepy luster, will, as you move past, 
      suddenly gleam forth as if it had burst into flame.
    </div>
    <div>
      How, in such a dark place, gold draws so much light to itself is a 
      mystery to me.
    </div>

      Modem man, in his well-lit house, knows nothing of the beauty of gold; 
      but those who lived in the dark houses of the past were not merely 
      captivated by its beauty, they also knew its practical value.

      Silver and other metals quickly lose their gloss, but gold retains its 
      brilliance indefinitely to light the darkness of the room. This is why 
      gold was held in such incredibly high esteem.
